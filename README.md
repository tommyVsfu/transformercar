My purpose is letting the car can use 4 sensors + web(controlled by NODEMCU) to avoid any obstacle
7/14 I will try to communicate NODEMCU with arduino and then build the web server!!
This is a wonderful project...if I succeed xd 

7/16  Click -> (WIFI) -> NodeMCU -> (UART) -> Arduino nano -> (UART) -> NodeMCU -> "It's ok" (but not upload yet)
